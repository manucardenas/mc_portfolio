          <p> I recently moved to Denver from Miami, FL in an attempt to satiate my love for the mountains and the outdoors. I am a web developer with experience in JavaScript, React, Ruby and Rails. Before transitioning careers into tech I was an Elementary School teacher to some pretty awesome kids and I hope to continue giving back to the community and the youth.</p>
          <p> When I'm not teaching or coding you can find me cooking for friends and family, hiking, camping or doing yoga. Now, that I live in Colorado, I'm picking up rock climbing so if you need an adventure partner, look no further!</p>
